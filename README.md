Diabetes Prediction Model (Machine Learning Project)
Developed a classification model to predict diabetes based on health metrics such as glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, and insulin levels.
Utilized Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook to process and analyze a dataset of 768 records.
Handled missing and zero-value data in critical columns (Insulin, SkinThickness) through imputation techniques.
Trained multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, optimizing performance using hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluated model accuracy with precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to improve prediction reliability.
Applied data visualization techniques to analyze correlations and feature importance, aiding model interpretability.
